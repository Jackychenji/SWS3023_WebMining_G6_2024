# NUS SOC Summer 2024 Workshop 1st Prize (Web Mining)

This project develops a hybrid music recommendation system and a segmented VIP bundled sales model by leveraging data from ​Last.fm and ​Netease Cloud Music, aiming to address the limitations of China’s costly, non-personalized music subscription services. 
The team collected and processed 4,844 albums (spanning 19 genres) and 5,000 user listening records from these platforms using web scraping tools like BeautifulSoup, structuring the data into user-album interaction tables, album details, and style tags. 
To tackle cold-start issues, a ​content-based (CB) approach prompts users to specify preferences (genres, eras, artists) and generates playlists via cosine similarity, while ​item-based collaborative filtering (CF) enhances personalization by analyzing user-album interactions. 
The hybrid CB-CF system aims to balance accuracy and adaptability. 
Additionally, the project proposes a cost-effective VIP sales model that groups users by musical preferences, replacing rigid “all-track buyout” subscriptions with tailored, lower-priced bundles. 
A web-based front-end demonstrates the recommendation system, allowing users to experience personalized playlists through an interactive interface accessible via QR code. 
By integrating multi-platform data, hybrid algorithms, and market-focused pricing strategies, the work offers a scalable framework for improving music service personalization and affordability in China’s digital entertainment landscape.
